# Conductor: www-reading-advantage

## Project Overview

This is the **Reading Advantage Platform** — a unified, static marketing website for the "Advantage" suite of educational curriculum products (Reading, Math, Science, STEM, Storytime, Zhongwen, CodeCamp, Tutor, and Primary). The site is a Next.js 15 App Router application deployed on Google Cloud Run, targeting school administrators, teachers, and parents in Thai private schools and international schools across Southeast Asia.

## Current Status (as of 2026-04-08)

- **Completed:** Site-wide refactor addressing performance, accessibility, and code quality
- **In Queue:** Services page finalization, Hero standardization, product page redesigns
- **Platform:** 9 product landing pages live, multilingual (EN/TH/ZH), deployed to Cloud Run

## Key Constraints

- **No Framer Motion** — all animations must use `tailwindcss-animate`
- **No hard-coded strings** — all text through `next-international` locale files
- **Server components by default** — only use `"use client"` when React state/hooks are needed
- **TypeScript strict** — build errors must not be ignored
