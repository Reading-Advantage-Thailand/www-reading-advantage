# Specification: 30-Day Marketing Blog Posts Generation

## Overview
This track focuses on generating all 30 blog posts outlined in the `conductor/marketing_plan_30_days.md` campaign. The posts will be localized into both English and Thai, and will include generated images. The generation process will utilize the `mmx` CLI tool, specifically leveraging the `create-image-mmx` and `create-text-mmx` skills.

## Functional Requirements
- **Content Generation:** Generate 30 blog posts in both English (`en`) and Thai (`th`) using the `mmx` CLI tool (`create-text-mmx` skill).
- **Image Generation:** Generate a relevant hero/cover image for each of the 30 blog posts using the `mmx` CLI tool (`create-image-mmx` skill).
- **Format:** Posts must be saved as Markdown files (`.md`) matching the existing format, including YAML frontmatter:
  - `title`: The localized title.
  - `date`: Publish date.
  - `excerpt`: A short summary of the post.
  - `coverImage`: Path to the generated image (e.g., `/blog/slug.webp`).
  - `author`: "Reading Advantage Marketing Team" (or similar).
  - `tags`: Relevant tags.
  - `readingTime`: Estimated reading time.
  - `product`: Absolute path to the relevant product/service page (e.g., `/products/math-advantage`). Must match the Advantage Page column in `conductor/marketing_plan_30_days.md`.
- **File Location:** 
  - English posts: `src/app/[locale]/(marketing)/blog/posts/en/`
  - Thai posts: `src/app/[locale]/(marketing)/blog/posts/th/`
  - Images: `public/blog/`

## Non-Functional Requirements
