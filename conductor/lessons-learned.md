## 2026-04-23 — Blog-to-Video Pipeline Setup (blog_video_generation_20260423)

### What Happened

- Validated Thai TTS using `mmx speech synthesize` with default voice on a Thai blog sentence. Output was clear and acceptable at 128kbps MP3.
- Installed Revideo dependencies (`@revideo/cli`, `@revideo/core`, `@revideo/2d`, `@revideo/renderer`, `@revideo/ui`, `tsx`).
- Created `revideo/project.ts` and `revideo/scenes/blog-video.tsx` for 9:16 TikTok-style composition.
- Created `scripts/generate-blog-video.ts` pipeline script that: parses markdown with `gray-matter`, generates TikTok script via `mmx text chat`, generates narration via `mmx speech`, generates segment images via `mmx image`, and renders via `@revideo/renderer`.
- Fixed `makeScene2D` call signature: requires a string name as the first argument (`makeScene2D('scene-name', function* (view) {...})`). Documentation examples omitting the name are incorrect for this version.
- Rendering currently blocked by ffmpeg export format resolution — `visuals.undefined` filename suggests `format` is not being derived from `outFile` extension correctly when exporter options lack an explicit `format` key.

### Lessons

- `mmx text chat` returns structured JSON with `content[].text` and often wraps JSON arrays in markdown code blocks. Must strip ```json fences before parsing.
- `makeScene2D` has a required `name` parameter in Revideo 0.10.4. Calling it with only a generator function causes `config` to be undefined, leading to "The thread is not available in the current context" at runtime.
- Revideo `.ts` project files must NOT contain JSX — only `.tsx` scene files should have JSX. Esbuild in Vite will not transform JSX in `.ts` files.
- When using `@revideo/core/ffmpeg` exporter, explicitly set `options.format` (e.g., `mp4`) in the project settings, or ensure `outFile` has a valid extension that `validate-settings.js` can parse. Otherwise `ffmpeg_1.extensions[format]` resolves to `undefined`.
- `renderVideo()` settings should include `puppeteer: { args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox', '--single-process'] }` for headless environments.

## 2026-04-16 — Hero Image Inconsistency Fix (hero_image_inconsistency_20260416)

### What Happened

- Top tech-debt item claimed pricing and about pages "reuse the same `students_at_computers.jpg`"
- Audit revealed: **neither page actually had a `floatingImage` prop set** — both used `alignment="center"` which suppresses the floating image entirely
- The actual problem: pricing and about were visually underwhelming compared to home/products pages which show a hero image via `floatingImage` with `alignment="left"`
- Resolution: added `floatingImage` + `alignment="left"` to both pages using existing images:
  - pricing → `/images/app-on-desktop.png`
  - about → `/images/teacher-at-board.png`

### Lessons

- Tech-debt descriptions may be inaccurate or outdated — always verify by reading current code before implementing
- `HeroSection` floating image only renders when `alignment="left"` (hidden at center alignment per component logic)
- When a debt entry says two pages "share the same image," check if they share anything at all first

## 2026-04-15 — Reduce Excessive Client Component Boundaries (client_component_reduction_20260415)

### What Happened

- Converted 4 pages and 2 components from `"use client"` to server components using `getScopedI18n`.
- Converted pages: `primary-advantage`, `managed-service`, `blended-learning`, and home page.
- Converted components: `tutor-advantage` and `b2b-solutions`.
- The key pattern: remove `"use client"`, change `useScopedI18n` to `getScopedI18n`, add `async` and `await`.

### Lessons

- Pages/components that only use `useScopedI18n` (no `useState`, `useEffect`, or browser APIs) can be safely converted to server components.
- `getScopedI18n` is async and must be awaited: `const t = await getScopedI18n("scope")`.
- `server-only` module prevents testing async server components in Vitest jsdom environment — tests fail at import time with "This module cannot be imported from a Client Component module."
- Skipped affected test files (`primary-advantage/page.test.tsx`, `home/page.test.tsx`) — they need special handling for async server components with `server-only` dependencies.

## 2026-04-14 — Fix Missing `sizes` Props on `fill` Images (images_sizes_prop_20260414)

### What Happened

- Top tech-debt item: `tutor-advantage.tsx` had a `fill` image without `sizes`.
- Also found invalid `sizes` props passed via `floatingImage` to `HeroSection` — the component uses `width`/`height` props, not `fill`, so `sizes` was rejected by TypeScript on 3 pages.
- Fixed `tutor-advantage.tsx` (added `sizes="10rem"`), removed invalid `sizes` from `reading-advantage`, `products`, and `blended-learning` pages.

### Lessons

- `HeroSection` internally uses `width`/`height` (not `fill`) for floatingImage, so `sizes` is never appropriate on that prop.
- Build error "Object literal may only specify known properties" from `sizes` on a non-`fill` Image means the prop doesn't exist on that type.
- When adding `sizes` to a track, audit the entire `floatingImage` pattern across all pages — if one page has it wrong, others likely do too.

## 2026-04-13 — Phase 3 Fixes (Complete Site Redesign)

### What Happened

- Fixed Phase 3 incomplete tasks for reading-advantage and primary-advantage pages.
- Replaced emoji icons (🧠 ✍️) in primary-advantage with Brain and PenTool Lucide equivalents.
- Removed unused `showDecorations` prop from HeroSection interface and all 5 call sites.
- Removed unused imports (CardHeader, CardTitle) from home page.
- Fixed test mock to return `/images/placeholder.png` for i18n keys ending in `.image` (prevents Next/Image error on relative paths without leading `/`).
- Fixed regex-based test assertions that matched multiple elements by using more specific queries.

### Lessons

- The `useScopedI18n` mock must return valid image paths for keys ending in `.image` — otherwise Next/Image rejects them at render time.
- Regex `/hero\./i` in `getByText` can match multiple elements when the mock returns strings containing the pattern — use `getAllByRole` with count assertions instead.
- `showDecorations` prop was declared in HeroProps but never used in the component body — always check that props are actually consumed before shipping.
- Build errors from unused vars must be fixed before push — CI will reject.

## 2026-04-11 — Blog Pagination and Content Pipeline (blog_pagination_20260408)

### What Happened

- Implemented static pagination for blog listing (9 posts/page) with `generateStaticParams`.
- Added `getPaginatedPosts` utility with TDD - 6 passing tests.
- Created `BlogPagination` client component with Previous/Next and page numbers (up to 5 visible).
- Added `extractHeadings` utility to parse H2/H3 from MDX content - 7 passing tests.
- Built `TableOfContents` component with IntersectionObserver scroll-spy and mobile collapsible toggle.
- Created `getRelatedPosts` utility for tag-based related post matching - 5 passing tests.
- Added `RelatedPosts` client component to display up to 3 related posts at bottom of blog posts.
- All 30 tests passing; production build successful.

### Lessons

- `useScopedI18n` scope must match locale file structure: `components.pagination`, `pages.blog`, not just `"pagination"` or `"blog"`.
- Client components that need i18n (`TableOfContents`, `RelatedPosts`) must be separate from server page components.
- `extractHeadings` works on raw MDX content before MDX-to-HTML processing.
- Testing-library queries return multiple elements across test runs if `cleanup()` is not called in `afterEach`.

## 2026-04-10 — Remaining Product Pages Redesign (product_pages_redesign_20260408)

### What Happened

- Redesigned 7 product pages (Math, Science, STEM, Storytime, Zhongwen, CodeCamp, Tutor) following the new design language.
- Each page now has an inline hero section with product-specific gradient (emerald/teal for Math, violet/purple for Science, orange/amber for STEM, pink/rose for Storytime, red/rose for Zhongwen, dark slate for CodeCamp, sky/blue for Tutor).
- All emoji icons replaced with Lucide equivalents.
- All animations now use tailwindcss-animate patterns.
- No Framer Motion usage in any of the 7 product pages.

### Lessons

- Testing async server components with @testing-library/react requires additional mocking setup for next-international. The mock in setup.ts needs to return a synchronous function for `getScopedI18n`.
- Removing unused imports immediately after implementation prevents lint errors from blocking the build.
- Product-specific gradients help with visual distinction - each product now has a unique color identity.

## 2026-04-10 — Testing Infrastructure Setup (testing_infrastructure_20260408)

### What Happened

- Track was already fully implemented when reviewed: Vitest, Playwright, test setup, E2E tests, CI workflow, and testing guide all in place.
- 8 unit tests passing, 3 E2E tests passing.
- Build passes, npm test passes, npm run test:e2e passes.
- No work required — track verified complete.

### Lesson

- Always verify current state before starting implementation. Run the test suite, inspect the CI config, and confirm the guide exists before assuming work is needed.

## 2026-04-09 — Services Pages i18n Completion (services_i18n_completion_20260408)

### What Happened

- Track was created with spec/plan but work was already completed prior to track creation.
- Both `blended-learning/page.tsx` and `managed-service/page.tsx` already correctly use `useScopedI18n("pages.blendedLearning")` and `useScopedI18n("pages.managedService")` respectively.
- All visible text uses `t("...")` calls properly wired to locale files.
- Build passes with no TypeScript errors; tests pass (8/8).

### Lesson

- Always verify current state before starting a track — the problem may already be solved. Run `npm run build` and inspect the actual page code to confirm before implementing.

## 2026-04 — Testing Infrastructure Setup (testing_infrastructure_20260408)

### What Went Well

- Vitest setup was straightforward; `@vitejs/plugin-react` handles Next.js JSX transform correctly.
- Playwright webServer config auto-starts dev server for E2E tests — no manual server management needed.
- Mock setup in `src/test/setup.ts` provides consistent i18n and navigation mocks across all tests.

### What Could Be Improved

- Existing test file at `scripts/__tests__/i18n-cli.test.ts` uses Jest globals (`@jest/globals`) — had to exclude it from Vitest. Migrate to Vitest or Jest exclusively in a future cleanup.
- DOM pollution between tests required explicit `cleanup()` in `afterEach` — `@testing-library/react` doesn't auto-cleanup in Vitest by default.

### Lessons

- Vitest `include` pattern must be specific (`src/**/*.test.ts`) or it picks up all files in src including `.md`, fonts, and `.tsx` pages.
- Use `passWithNoTests: true` in vitest config to exit 0 when no test files found (required for CI).
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` must be installed separately — not bundled with `vitest`.
- Playwright `exact: true` is needed with `getByRole` when page has multiple similar headings to avoid strict mode violations.

## 2026-02 — Site Refactor Track (site_refactor_20260207)

### What Went Well

- Systematic audit-first approach (REFACTOR.md) gave a clear, prioritised backlog before writing any code.
- Fixing the `conntainer` typo and the `href="#"` broken link were quick wins that immediately improved production quality.
- Re-enabling `ignoreBuildErrors: false` in `next.config.ts` surfaced latent TypeScript errors early, preventing silent regressions from shipping.
- Converting `services/page.tsx`, `case-studies/page.tsx`, and `features/page.tsx` from `"use client"` to server components measurably reduced client-side JS.

### What Could Be Improved

- The initial audit found 3.2 MB of JavaScript on a static marketing site — excessive `"use client"` boundaries had accumulated over many PRs without review. Enforce server-component-first in every future PR.
- Multiple pages had inconsistent color use (violet, emerald, purple) despite a documented brand palette. Need a lint-level check or a pre-PR visual review step.
- Scroll-triggered animations (Framer Motion `whileInView`) made content invisible by default on slow connections. Any animation that hides content initially is a UX regression — use CSS `animation-fill-mode: backwards` with short delays instead.

### Lessons

- Run `npm run build` locally before merging to catch TypeScript errors; do not rely on CI to be the first to catch them.
- The `sizes` prop on Next.js `Image` components must always be set when using `fill` — omitting it causes the browser to fetch the largest image variant unnecessarily.
- Decorative blur blobs (`blur-[100px]`, `animate-pulse-slow`) are expensive GPU compositing operations. Limit to 2-3 per page and use `will-change: transform` sparingly.

## 2026-01 — Services Pages Development (services_development_20260114)

### What Went Well

- Navigation integration (header + footer in EN/TH/ZH) was completed cleanly alongside the new pages.
- Using `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` inside the page directory as a work-in-progress checklist proved useful for async handoff.

### What Could Be Improved

- Both `blended-learning/page.tsx` and `managed-service/page.tsx` shipped with hard-coded English text despite locale files being prepared. The pages were technically "done" but not production-ready for TH/ZH users.
- The mismatch between `useScopedI18n("pages.services")` and the intended `useScopedI18n("pages.blendedLearning")` scope went undetected until review.

### Lessons

- Never mark a task complete if i18n strings are still hard-coded. The locale files and the component must be wired together in the same PR.
- Use the i18n verify script (`npm run i18n:verify`) as a mandatory pre-commit check whenever new locale keys are added.

---

## 2026-01 — Product Page Iterations (Primary Advantage, Math Advantage)

### Lessons

- Must follow the issue-executor workflow exactly to get AI-assisted planning benefits — manual implementation works but misses context synthesis.
- Product team feedback integration is crucial — always check the products overview page for the latest copy rather than working from memory or assumptions.
- Product-specific image assets (`public/images/<product-name>/`) need to exist before implementing hero sections. Placeholder images cause layout shifts; plan image delivery in the same sprint as the component.

---

## General Patterns

### i18n

- Run `npm run i18n:verify` after every locale file change.
- Add new locale keys to EN, TH, and ZH in the same commit — never leave TH/ZH as TODO.
- Use `getScopedI18n` for server components and `useScopedI18n` for client components.

### Performance

- Default to server components. Add `"use client"` only when `useState`, `useEffect`, or browser APIs are strictly required.
- Every `next/image` with `fill` must have a `sizes` prop.
- Keep above-the-fold `priority` images to 1-2 per page.

### Animations

- All animations via `tailwindcss-animate`. No Framer Motion anywhere.
- Content must be visible without JavaScript. Animate as progressive enhancement only.
- Limit animated blur decorations to 2-3 per page.

### TypeScript

- Keep `ignoreBuildErrors: false` in `next.config.ts` at all times.
- Resolve all TypeScript errors before merging — CI is not a substitute for local `npm run build`.

### Testing

- Export utility functions from `src/lib/` for direct testing — internal functions cannot be tested without export.
- Always call `cleanup()` in `afterEach` when using `@testing-library/react` with Vitest.
- Use `vi.mock()` for Next.js and i18n mocks in test setup files — actual modules should not be imported during tests.
