## Key Components and Their Interactions

### Layout Components

- **RootLayout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
  - Main application shell
  - Handles global styling and metadata
  - Wraps application in AuthProvider
  - Implements page transitions
  - Contains header and footer structure

### Authentication System

- **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`)
  - Manages user authentication state
  - Provides authentication methods:
    - Email/Password sign in
    - Google sign in
    - Sign out functionality
  - Handles auth state persistence
  - Provides loading states

### Navigation System

- **Navigation Configuration** (`src/config/navigation.ts`)
  - Centralized navigation structure
  - Product routes and metadata
  - Main site navigation links
  - Type-safe navigation using TypeScript

### Product Pages

- Individual product pages under `src/app/products/`
  - Reading Advantage
  - Math Advantage
  - Science Advantage
  - STEM Advantage
  - Zhongwen Advantage
  - Storytime Advantage
  - CodeCamp Advantage
  - Tutor Advantage

### Blog System

- MDX-based blog implementation
- Post processing pipeline
- Category and tag system
- Dynamic routing for blog posts

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User authentication state managed by Firebase
2. AuthContext provides global auth state
3. Protected routes check auth status
4. Auth state persists across sessions

### Navigation Flow

1. Navigation configuration defines available routes
2. Dynamic product links generated from configuration
3. Type-safe navigation using TypeScript interfaces
4. Header component consumes navigation config

### Content Rendering Flow

1. Pages built using Next.js App Router
2. Server-side rendering for optimal performance
3. Client-side transitions with Framer Motion
4. MDX content processing for blog posts

## External Dependencies

### Firebase Integration

- Authentication services
- User management
- Security rules implementation

### Content Management

- MDX processing pipeline
- Markdown transformation
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-linking headers

## Development Workflow

### Component Development

1. Components created in `src/components/`
2. Styled using Tailwind CSS
3. TypeScript for type safety
4. Reusable UI components from shadcn/ui

### Page Creation

1. Pages created in `src/app/` directory
2. Layout components for consistent structure
3. Server and client components separation
4. SEO optimization through metadata

### State Management

1. React Context for global state
2. Component-level state when appropriate
3. Server state management with Next.js
