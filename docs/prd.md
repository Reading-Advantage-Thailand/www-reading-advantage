## Backlog Traceability

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Access to Firebase project credentials and any marketing analytics tooling.
- Design assets (logos, imagery) live in `public/` and can be expanded.
- Team has GitHub access to use workflow templates and issue automation.
- Blog authors comfortable contributing MDX until CMS decision is made.
