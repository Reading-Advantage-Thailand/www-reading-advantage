## BREAKING CHANGES

### Authentication Removed

The site no longer supports user login/signup or any authentication functionality. All Firebase authentication has been permanently removed. The Reading Advantage platform is now a **static marketing experience** that links to external product platforms.

#### What Changed
- **Firebase Authentication**: Completely removed from the codebase
- **Login/Signup UI**: All authentication interfaces removed from navigation and components
- **Login Route**: `/login` route decommissioned with 301 redirects to home page
- **Auth Context**: All client-side authentication infrastructure eliminated
- **Package Dependencies**: Firebase and related auth packages removed (74 dependencies)

#### Impact for Users
- **No User Accounts**: Visitors can no longer create accounts or log in
- **Static Experience**: The site operates as a marketing brochure only
- **External Platforms**: Products requiring authentication are hosted on separate platforms
- **Redirects**: Any attempts to access `/login` will redirect to the home page

#### Technical Details
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by removing Firebase SDK
- **Build Process**: No longer includes authentication-related code
- **Environment Variables**: Removed all Firebase/auth configuration
- **CI/CD**: Updated workflows to remove auth-specific steps

## Future Considerations

### If Authentication is Needed in Future
Any future authentication requirements will be addressed through:
1. **New Specification**: A fresh spec will be authored rather than resurrecting deprecated code
2. **External Platforms**: Authenticated experiences will be hosted on separate platforms
3. **Clear Separation**: Marketing site will remain static and unauthenticated

### Related Work
This change enables:
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Better Performance**: Smaller bundle sizes and faster load times
- **Focus on Marketing**: Clear separation between marketing and product experiences
