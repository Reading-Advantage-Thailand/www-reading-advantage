# Specs Index

Create a subdirectory per capability and include at minimum a `spec.md`. Optional `design.md` files capture architecture details or sequence diagrams.

Suggested capabilities based on current roadmap:
- `content/blogging`
- `identity/authentication`
- `experience/internationalization`
- `experience/theming`
- `operations/ci-cd`
- `quality/testing`
- `marketing/seo`

Run `init-spec <capability-name>` before authoring new specs to ensure consistent structure.
