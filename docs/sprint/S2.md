# Sprint S2 - Content Verification & Localization Quality

## Goal
After consolidating localization tooling (per `experience/localization-maintenance`), verify every marketing page contains accurate, current information and ensure updates are reflected in all supported locales. Introduce the new Primary Advantage page aligned with the existing design system.

## Milestone Checklist
- [ ] Run `i18n:verify` to confirm single source of truth is active
- [ ] Complete page-by-page content validation issues (one issue per page)
- [ ] Update localized content for each verified page (English, Thai, Simplified Chinese)
- [ ] Launch Primary Advantage product page with localized copy and correct brand colors
- [ ] Document refresh outcomes and outstanding gaps in `docs/prd.md` / specs

## Execution Approach
1. Use AI-assisted reviews: each page issue includes a back-and-forth transcript validating factual accuracy, timelines, and external links.
2. Once content is approved, commit updates across all locales using the localization CLI (`i18n:update` + `i18n:tree`).
3. Track deltas in specs or appendix logs if messaging/positioning changes materially.
