# Sprint S1 - Authentication Retirement

## Goal
Permanently remove all authentication functionality (Firebase, login UI, routes, copy) from the marketing site so the platform operates as a purely static brochure experience.

## Milestone Checklist
- [ ] Confirm no runtime dependencies on Firebase/auth packages remain
- [ ] Remove `/login` route and related navigation elements
- [ ] Strip auth context, hooks, and provider usage from the codebase
- [ ] Clean up environment variables, CI secrets, and documentation referencing auth
- [ ] Update marketing copy to reflect unauthenticated experience

## Execution Approach
1. Review `docs/specs/identity/login-removal/spec.md` for detailed requirements.
2. Audit the codebase with provided tooling to ensure all auth references are located.
3. Coordinate with stakeholders to document the removal in release notes and README.
