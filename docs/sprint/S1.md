# Sprint S1 - Authentication Retirement

## Goal
Permanently remove all authentication functionality (Firebase, login UI, routes, copy) from the marketing site so the platform operates as a purely static brochure experience.

## Milestone Checklist
- [ ] Confirm no runtime dependencies on Firebase/auth packages remain
- [ ] Remove `/login` route and related navigation elements
- [ ] Strip auth context, hooks, and provider usage from the codebase
- [ ] Clean up environment variables, CI secrets, and documentation referencing auth
- [ ] Update marketing copy to reflect unauthenticated experience

## Execution Approach
1. Review `docs/specs/identity/login-removal/spec.md` for detailed requirements.
2. Audit the codebase with provided tooling to ensure all auth references are located.
3. Coordinate with stakeholders to document the removal in release notes and README.

Create additional issues if new auth-related artifacts are discovered during execution. Run `seed-sprint docs/sprint/S1.md` once all prerequisite specs are approved.
