## Upcoming Tracks (created 2026-04-08)

### [ ] Track: Reduce Excessive Client Component Boundaries

**Status:** New

**Type:** refactor | **Estimated Tasks:** 6

**Description:** Convert pages/components that only use `useScopedI18n` (no useState, useEffect, or browser APIs) from "use client" to server components using `getScopedI18n`. This reduces JS bundle size by moving static content to the server bundle.

**Status:** New

**Type:** bug | **Estimated Tasks:** 4
